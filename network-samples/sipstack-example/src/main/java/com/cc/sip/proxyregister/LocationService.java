/**
 * If you did the {@link Registrar} example you saw how we created an association with a AOR
 * (address-of-record) and a particular Contact address. We simply stored this in the same scope as
 * the registrar handler itself but overall there wasn't much use to that example since you could
 * only register and nothing else. Typically, you have a location store, where the registrar manages
 * the bindings and someone else, such as a location aware proxy, reads those bindings and does
 * something useful with it.
 *
 * This is the location service where we will store the associations between an AOR and the contact
 * addresses where we can reach the AOR. This is a very simple in-memory location store and normally
 * you would either use some kind of distributed storage, such as redis, hazelcast etc or perhaps a
 * plain DB (you should ask yourself why you really need a DB though)
